Chitti: I think you meant to ask "Can you tell me instruments clearly?". If so, there are many types of instruments, but here are some common ones:
 Musical instruments: piano, guitar, violin, drums, trumpet, etc.
 Laboratory instruments: microscope, thermometer, spectrometer, etc.
 Surgical instruments: scalpel, forceps, scissors, etc.
Let me know if you're looking for something specific!
